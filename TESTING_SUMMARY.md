### 2. Authentication API Tests (11 tests)
**File**: `tests/authSimple.test.js`
- ✅ User registration with validation
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Existing user detection
- ✅ User login with credentials
- ✅ Invalid credential rejection
- ✅ Non-existent user handling
- ✅ Email verification requirements
- ✅ Email verification with valid/invalid codes
- ✅ Verification code expiration
- ✅ Complete registration → verification → login flow

### 3. Database Integration Tests (18 tests)
**File**: `tests/database.test.js`
- ✅ User model CRUD operations
- ✅ User profile updates

- Token generation and validation
- Admin authentication separation

### 2. Database Integrity Testing
- CRUD operations for all models
- Data validation and constraints
- Error handling and recovery
- Relationship management
- Cart operations and state management

### 3. API Endpoint Testing
- RESTful API validation
- Request/response handling
- Error status codes
- Authentication middleware
- Admin authorization

### 4. Business Logic Testing
- E-commerce workflows
- Payment processing
- Inventory management
- User experience flows
- Error scenarios and recovery

## Test Execution Results

### Backend Tests Status
```
✅ Basic API Tests: 5/5 passing
✅ Authentication Tests: 11/11 passing  
✅ Database Integration Tests: 18/18 passing
Total: 34/34 passing tests
```

### Frontend Tests Status
```
✅ Authentication Components: 32/32 passing
⚠️ UI Components: 13/32 tests passing (structure mismatches)
Total: 45/74 tests passing
```
